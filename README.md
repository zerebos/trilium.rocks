# [Trilium Rocks!](https://trilium.rocks/) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1155302051987849320?style=flat-square&logo=discord&logoColor=white&label=Discord&color=%235865F2)](https://discord.gg/eTaTXUgcBr)

[Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) really does rock! Don't believe me? Well I created the entire [trilium.rocks](https://trilium.rocks) website using the shared notes feature inside Trilium with a little bit of extra CSS and JS also contained in Trilium. That JS and CSS? That's what you'll find here in this repository.

**Disclaimer:** This project and website is not at all affiliated with Trilium Notes or its creator(s).

## Why?

I love Trilium, it has made me the most organized I have ever been in my many many years of digital storage. The only thing I found lacking was the centralization of information. The [wiki](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki) is a great resource, but it's outdated in some areas, and lacking in many many othersâ€”especially in regards to developing addons for Trilium. I also don't personally use gitter so the [official Trilium gitter](https://gitter.im/trilium-notes/Lobby) is not useful for me, and last time I checked it was _very_ inactive. So I made the website [trilium.rocks](https://trilium.rocks) and [a Discord server](https://discord.gg/eTaTXUgcBr) to try and help with each of those respectively.

With the website, I want to at least provide supplementary knowledge to the wiki by adding extended guides for users and developers. I also want to try and make it a more user-friendly central place to browse addons.

With the Discord server, I wanted to interact with the community and see what kind of addons people may be interested in. It also provides a quick and easy way to provide support to people, or even get support from others. And hopefully, it lets the community's developers come together to share information and make all of our addons even better.

## About The Site

Rather than saying some specific goals of what this site strives to be, I'll say what it strives not to be. This site is not meant to be a complete recreation of the Wiki with every detail and page included. It is meant to be a (mostly) one-stop shop for users and developers alike looking to supplement their knowledge. It may at some point expand and include everything from the wiki because users tend to prefer a fancier UI like this, but it is not the end-goal. It also may move in that direction if [zadam](https://github.com/zadam) wants to use this (or parts of this) project as part of the in-app documentation.

## Contributing

Since the entire site is just a share from my personal Trilium instance, there is no easy way to contribute new pages or fixes for typos. For now, this GitHub repo's issues and discussion can be used as places to contribute bug reports, feature requests, and even documentation contributions. But who knows, maybe soon I'll think of some clever way to introduce contributions directly to my Trilium instance.

## Trilium Next

The theme works with [Trilium Next Notes]([url](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes)) also, with some adjustment.

* Ensure _Embedded Javascript_ mime-type for Code Notes is enabled in _Options_ (in order to use that attribute for the _theme_ notes, see [TN #846]([url](https://github.com/orgs/TriliumNext/discussions/846)).
* Edit `src/theme/page.ejs` and change `<link href="../<%= assetPath %>/libraries/normalize.min.css" rel="stylesheet">` to `<link href="../<%= assetPath %>/libraries/normalize.min.css" rel="stylesheet">` (see [#4]([url](https://github.com/zerebos/trilium.rocks/issues/4)))
